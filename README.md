## ü§òüèª HELLO THERE ü§òüèª

### This repo contains my submission to a coding assignment

#### I have also added tests to each exercise in test.js file

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and open in your code editor of choice

```
git clone https://github.com/MohammedAK1991/Qoala_assignment
```

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```
3. In the root, create a .env.local file with the following variables:
```
REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_API_ACCESS_KEY= <your api key goes here>
```
4. Start the application on localhost
```
npm start
```
## API Keys

For this demo to work, you must get an API key (along with secret code and collection name) from  [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

####  Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#####  `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#####  `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
